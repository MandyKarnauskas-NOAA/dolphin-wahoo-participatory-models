presence of large sargassum mats,wahoo catchability,0.28,wahoo are found under sargassum mats and other floating objects
price of dolphin,number of longline fishermen,0,an increased market price makes the fishery more profitable and affects the number of commercial fishermen
range of recreational fishing,recreational landings,0,an increased range of recreational fisheries increases the availability and therefore landings of fish
recreational fishing effort on dolphin and wahoo,recreational landings,0,a decrease in recreational fishing effort with reduce landings
recreational landings,local dolphin and wahoo abundance,0,recreational landings affect local abundance of wahoo and dolphin
risk,range of recreational fishing,0,access to technology allows mediocre fishermen to go out farther (decreasing risk of not catching anything) which increases the range that they can cover
season length for YFT,recreational fishing effort on dolphin and wahoo,0,a reduction in season length for yellowfin tuna causes increase in effort on dolphin and wahoo
seasonal migration,ability to catch dolphin and wahoo through year,0,the ability to catch wahoo and dolphin during different parts of the year is affected by their seasonal migrations
sewage regulation,coastal development,0,the strength of the sewage regulations have limited coastal development in some areas
size and bag limits,ability to catch dolphin and wahoo through year,0,size and bag limits decrease ability of wahoo and dolphin throuhout the year because different size classes are in abundance in different seasons
size and bag limits,customer satisfaction,0,if you don't let customers bring back as much meat it will reduce satisfaction; people want to take full coolers home
tastiness and desirability,price of dolphin,0,dolphin fetches a higher price because it is tasty
