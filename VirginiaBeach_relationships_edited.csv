tropical.weather.systems,Gulf.Stream,0,tropical weather systems affect the position of the Gulf Stream,tropical weather systems,,
tropical.weather.systems,wind,0,tropical weather systems affect wind patterns on short temporal scales,Gulf Stream,Gulf Stream position ,when thinking about what attribute of the Gulf Stream is linked to weather systems and eddies it is mostly the position which drives how it interacts with the bathymetry
tropical.weather.systems,water.clarity,0,tropical weather systems affect water conditions and clarity; e.g. inshore runoff,eddies,eddy activity,"eddy activity is more quantifiable than ""eddies"" and captures what is driving the congregation of floating objects and bait"
Gulf.Stream,eddies,0,the Gulf Stream produces eddies as it flows and interacts with the ocean floor,wind,strong winds,since this is attached to weather systems we are talking about strong winds and not tradewinds for example
eddies,surface.objects,0,eddy activity drives local convergence zones where floating objects congregate,temperature breaks,,
wind,surface.objects,0,strong winds break up convergence zones and Sargassum lines,water clarity,,
temperature.breaks,surface.objects,0,temperature breaks are also frontal zones that cause floating objects to congregate,bait concentration,,
water.clarity,bait.concentration,0,bait are not necessarily found on all weed lines; it depends on water quality as well,surface objects,presence of weedlines,it is the presence of weedlines or convergence zones that drive the bait abundance
bait.concentration,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines,availability of large gaffer dolphin,,
bait.concentration,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines,availability of small dolphin,,
surface.objects,bait.concentration,0,bait concentrate around the weedlines and other floating objects,use of circle hooks,,
availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,fishing.efficiency,0,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year,fishing efficiency,,
availability.of.small.dolphin,fishing.efficiency,0,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year,dolphin population abundance,,
use.of.circle.hooks,fishing.efficiency,0,,consumer demand,,
fishing.efficiency,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,as fishing efficiency or catchability increases there are more landings per unit effort,tuna and marlin fishing opportunity,,
dolphin.population.abundance,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin,?,,
dolphin.population.abundance,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin,water temperature,,
consumer.demand,charter.demand,0,these are essentially the same,seasonal migrations,,
tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,consumer.demand,0,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the demand for charter trips,charter demand,,
tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,private.angler.effort,0,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the private angler effort offshore,pictures on social media,,
X.,dolphin.population.abundance,0,the factors driving the total dolphin abundance at the population scale are unknown,consumer satisfaction,,
water.temperature,tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,0,tuna and marlin are locally available for capture at certain times of the year driven by water temperature,trip activity excitement,fishing trip activity/excitement,clarifying that it is the amount of activity and the level of excitement; now sure how to best capture this
water.temperature,seasonal.migrations,0,seasonal migrations of dolphin are largely determined by water temperature,total local dolphin landings,,
seasonal.migrations,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,large gaffer dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate,tournaments,number of tournaments,convert to something more quantifiable
seasonal.migrations,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,small dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate,private landings,,
charter.demand,number.of.charter.trips,0,the number of charter trips is driven by the demand for charters,private angler effort,,
pictures.on.social.media,consumer.satisfaction,0,consumer satisfaction is driven by excitement over pictures of catch which are shared on social media,distance from fish,,
pictures.on.social.media,private.angler.effort,0,when local folks see pictures of charter catches on social media they go out fishing,weather,bad weather,it is not all weather but only bad weather that affects ability to fish
consumer.satisfaction,consumer.demand,0,satisfication with charter trips drives an increase in demand for the activity,desirability for eating,,
trip.activity.excitement,consumer.satisfaction,0,consumer satisfaction is driven by the number and variety of fish caught; often dolphin is an important species within this mix,number of charter trips,,
tournaments,use.of.circle.hooks,0,tournaments require the use of circle hooks,concentration of dolphin,,
tournaments,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,tournament effort affects the total number of local landings,shark abundance,,
private.landings,pictures.on.social.media,0,private anglers upload pictures of their catches to social media,commercial fishing effort,,
private.landings,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,private angler landings contribute to the total dolphin landings locally,charter landings,,
private.angler.effort,private.landings,0,landings from private anglers increase as the private sector effort increases,NA,,
distance.from.fish,private.angler.effort,0,in some locations along the coast the dolphin are only available further offshore and this is a limiting factor for some private anglers,NA,,
weather,private.angler.effort,0,bad weather makes it difficult to go fishing and reduces private angler effort,NA,,
desirability.for.eating,consumer.satisfaction,0,catching dolphin contributes to consumer satisfaction because they are a highly desireable meat fish,NA,,
desirability.for.eating,total.local.dolphin.landings,NA,,NA,,changed to NA because I think this is erroneous - desireability leads to increased effort but not landings? 
number.of.charter.trips,charter.landings,0,the charter landings increase as the total number of trips increases,NA,,
concentration.of.dolphin,commercial.fishing.effort,0,in some areas dolphin do not occur in sufficient concentrations for them to be targeted by commercial fisheries,NA,,
shark.abundance,commercial.fishing.effort,0,high abundance of sharks makes it impractical to fish for dolphin commercially in some areas,NA,,
commercial.fishing.effort,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,total local landings increase as the commercial effort increases,NA,,
charter.landings,pictures.on.social.media,0,more charter landings drive more pictures of the catch on social media,NA,,
charter.landings,trip.activity.excitement,0,higher catches contribute to the excitement of charter trips,NA,,
charter.landings,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,total local landings increase as charter landings increase,NA,,
