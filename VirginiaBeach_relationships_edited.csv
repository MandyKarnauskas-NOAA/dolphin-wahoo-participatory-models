influences,isInfluenced,rel,description
availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,fishing.efficiency,0,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year
availability.of.small.dolphin,fishing.efficiency,0,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year
bait.concentration,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines
bait.concentration,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines
charter.demand,number.of.charter.trips,0,the number of charter trips is driven by the demand for charters
charter.landings,pictures.on.social.media,0,more charter landings drive more pictures of the catch on social media
charter.landings,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,total local landings increase as charter landings increase
charter.landings,trip.activity.excitement,0,higher catches contribute to the excitement of charter trips
commercial.fishing.effort,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,total local landings increase as the commercial effort increases
concentration.of.dolphin,commercial.fishing.effort,0,in some areas dolphin do not occur in sufficient concentrations for them to be targeted by commercial fisheries
consumer.demand,charter.demand,0,these are essentially the same
consumer.satisfaction,consumer.demand,0,satisfication with charter trips drives an increase in demand for the activity
desirability.for.eating,consumer.satisfaction,0,catching dolphin contributes to consumer satisfaction because they are a highly desireable meat fish
desirability.for.eating,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,changed to NA because I think this is erroneous - desireability leads to increased effort but not landings? 
distance.from.fish,private.angler.effort,0,in some locations along the coast the dolphin are only available further offshore and this is a limiting factor for some private anglers
dolphin.population.abundance,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin
dolphin.population.abundance,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin
eddies,surface.objects,0,eddy activity drives local convergence zones where floating objects congregate
fishing.efficiency,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,as fishing efficiency or catchability increases there are more landings per unit effort
Gulf.Stream,eddies,0,the Gulf Stream produces eddies as it flows and interacts with the ocean floor
number.of.charter.trips,charter.landings,0,the charter landings increase as the total number of trips increases
pictures.on.social.media,consumer.satisfaction,0,consumer satisfaction is driven by excitement over pictures of catch which are shared on social media
pictures.on.social.media,private.angler.effort,0,when local folks see pictures of charter catches on social media they go out fishing
private.angler.effort,private.landings,0,landings from private anglers increase as the private sector effort increases
private.landings,pictures.on.social.media,0,private anglers upload pictures of their catches to social media
private.landings,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,private angler landings contribute to the total dolphin landings locally
seasonal.migrations,availability.of.large.gaffer.dolphin,0,large gaffer dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate
seasonal.migrations,availability.of.small.dolphin,0,small dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate
shark.abundance,commercial.fishing.effort,0,high abundance of sharks makes it impractical to fish for dolphin commercially in some areas
surface.objects,bait.concentration,0,bait concentrate around the weedlines and other floating objects
temperature.breaks,surface.objects,0,temperature breaks are also frontal zones that cause floating objects to congregate
tournaments,total.local.dolphin.landings,0,tournament effort affects the total number of local landings
tournaments,use.of.circle.hooks,0,tournaments require the use of circle hooks
trip.activity.excitement,consumer.satisfaction,0,consumer satisfaction is driven by the number and variety of fish caught; often dolphin is an important species within this mix
tropical.weather.systems,Gulf.Stream,0,tropical weather systems affect the position of the Gulf Stream
tropical.weather.systems,water.clarity,0,tropical weather systems affect water conditions and clarity; e.g. inshore runoff
tropical.weather.systems,wind,0,tropical weather systems affect wind patterns on short temporal scales
tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,consumer.demand,0,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the demand for charter trips
tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,private.angler.effort,0,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the private angler effort offshore
use.of.circle.hooks,fishing.efficiency,0,less likely to retain hooked small dolphin on a circle hook; reduced efficiency
water.clarity,bait.concentration,0,bait are not necessarily found on all weed lines; it depends on water quality as well
water.temperature,seasonal.migrations,0,seasonal migrations of dolphin are largely determined by water temperature
water.temperature,tuna.and.marlin.fishing.opportunity,0,tuna and marlin are locally available for capture at certain times of the year driven by water temperature
weather,private.angler.effort,0,bad weather makes it difficult to go fishing and reduces private angler effort
wind,surface.objects,0,strong winds break up convergence zones and Sargassum lines
X.,dolphin.population.abundance,0,the factors driving the total dolphin abundance at the population scale are unknown
