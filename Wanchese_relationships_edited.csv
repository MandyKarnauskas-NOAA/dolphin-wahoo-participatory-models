Gulf.Stream,sargassum.habitat,0,Sargassum habitat is affected by the Gulf Stream
temperature,sargassum.habitat,0,
no.stock.assessment,inability.to.manage,0,a lack of stock assessments for dolphin and wahoo make them challenging to manage
seasonal.changes,migratory.patterns,0,migrations are affected by seasonal changes; specifically temperature
international.effort,unreported.catch,0,
international.effort,international.bycatch,0,international fisheries have less stringent regulations and therefore produce more bycatch

social.media,community.conflict,0,
private.recreational.effort,local.wahoo.abundance,0,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local wahoo abundance
private.recreational.effort,local.dolphin.abundance,0,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local dolphin abundance
private.recreational.effort,unreported.sales,0,increase in private recreational effort results in more opportunities for unreported sales
charter.CPUE,charter.landings,0,an increase in charter fleet CPUE will increase landings if effort is stable
charter.landings,local.dolphin.abundance,0,charter landings have an impact on the local dolphin abundance
abundance.in.other.regions,local.dolphin.abundance,0,local dolphin abundance is driven by dolphin migrating from unknown regions within the stock's domain
FL.abundance,local.dolphin.abundance,0,local dolphin abundance is driven by dolphin migrating from Florida
commercial.catch,local.dolphin.abundance,0,commercial catch has an impact on the local dolphin abundance
commercial.catch,seafood.supply,0,an increase in commercial catch increases local seafood supply
large.dolphin.local.abundance,local.dolphin.abundance,0,an increase in large dolphin abundance is equivalent to an increase in total abundance
economic.growth,private.recreational.effort,0,with increased economic growth there is more spending and more recreational effort

lack.of.regulation,private.recreational.effort,0,
mobility.of.recreational.anglers,private.recreational.effort,0,greater mobility of recreational anglers (e.g. with trailers) allows for increased private recreational effort
blueline.tilefish.closure,number.of.council.boats,0,with the closure of blueline tilefish fisheries some fishermen have moved to target dolphin
number.of.council.boats,commercial.effort..council.,0,as the number of council boats increases the commercial effort will increase

PLL.effort,PLL.catch,0,increased longline effort will increase the landings
commercial.effort..council.,commercial.catch,0,increased Council boat effort will increase the commercial catch
coastal.development,private.recreational.effort,0,increased coastal development spurs increased private recreational effort
