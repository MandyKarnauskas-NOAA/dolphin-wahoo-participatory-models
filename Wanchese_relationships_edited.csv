blueline tilefish closure,number of council boats,0,with the closure of blueline tilefish fisheries some fishermen have moved to target dolphin
catch per unit effort,commercial catch,0,increased CPUE leads to increased catch if effort remains stable
charter CPUE,charter landings,0,an increase in charter fleet CPUE will increase landings if effort is stable
charter effort,charter landings,0,a reduction in charter effort will reduce charter landings
charter landings,local dolphin abundance,0,charter landings have an impact on the local dolphin abundance
coastal development,private recreational effort,0,increased coastal development spurs increased private recreational effort
commercial catch,local dolphin abundance,0,commercial catch has an impact on the local dolphin abundance

dolphin population abundance,FL abundance,0,total dolphin population abundance is related to the abundance in the Florida subregion
economic growth,private recreational effort,0,with increased economic growth there is more spending and more recreational effort
fishing power,private recreational effort,0,NA
FL abundance,local dolphin abundance,0,local dolphin abundance is driven by dolphin migrating from Florida
gear and hook restrictions,bycatch of sharks etc,0,hook size affects bycatch of sharks
gear and hook restrictions,catch per unit effort,0,hook size affects CPUE
gear and hook restrictions,PLL catch,0,hook size affects CPUE and thus total catch
Gulf Stream,sargassum habitat,0,Sargassum habitat is affected by the Gulf Stream
import price,local business profit,0,local profits are lower when market prices are reduced by cheap imports
inability to manage,lack of regulation,0,synonymous; level of ability to manage impacts level of ability to create regulations
international bycatch,import price,0,the presence of bycatch does not cause the price to be lower; perhaps replace with 'bycatch standards' so that relationship is apparent; lower standards allow cost savings and reduce price
international effort,dolphin population abundance,0,international fishing effort has an impact on the overall population abundance
international effort,import price,0,with increased effort there is increased supply and the price decreases
international effort,international bycatch,0,international fisheries have less stringent regulations and therefore produce more bycatch
international effort,unreported catch,0,increase in international effort leads to increase in unreported catch
lack of data on private recreational catch,accountability,0,lack of data for private rec sector reduces the accountability in the fishery
lack of data on private recreational catch,inability to manage,0,NA
lack of regulation,lack of data on private recreational catch,0,if not regulated then it makes it difficult to collect data
lack of regulation,private recreational effort,0,few regulations leads to unconstrained effort
large dolphin local abundance,demand for charter trips,0,NA
large dolphin local abundance,local dolphin abundance,0,an increase in large dolphin abundance is equivalent to an increase in total abundance
local dolphin abundance,charter business,0,local abundance increases opportunity for charter businesses
local dolphin abundance,community conflict,0,when local abundance is depleted it creates community conflict
local dolphin abundance,tournaments,0,local abundance increases opportunity for tournament fishing
migratory patterns,local dolphin abundance,0,the local abundance of dolphin is affected by their seasonal migrations
migratory patterns,local wahoo abundance,0,the local abundance of wahoo is affected by their seasonal migrations
mobility of recreational anglers,private recreational effort,0,greater mobility of recreational anglers (e g  with trailers) allows for increased private recreational effort
no stock assessment,inability to manage,0,a lack of stock assessments for dolphin and wahoo make them challenging to manage
number of council boats,commercial effort council,0,as the number of council boats increases the commercial effort will increase
PLL catch,large dolphin local abundance,0,PLL fishery targets large dolphin and causes local depletion
PLL effort,bycatch of sharks etc,0,increased longline effort will increase bycatch of sharks and other species
PLL effort,PLL catch,0,increased longline effort will increase the landings
private recreational effort,local dolphin abundance,0,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local dolphin abundance
private recreational effort,local wahoo abundance,0,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local wahoo abundance
private recreational effort,unreported sales,0,increase in private recreational effort results in more opportunities for unreported sales
propaganda,regulations,0,pressure to reduce fishing on sharks led to stronger regulations
quality of information,regulation level,0,
range shifts,migratory patterns,0,large-scale range shifts lead to changing migration patterns; e g  fish moving further north
regulation level,number of council boats,0,few regulations leads to unconstrained effort
regulations on bait,catch per unit effort,0,whole squid must be used and this decreases CPUE
regulations,sharks,0,stronger restrictions on shark fishing have led to increase in shark populations
sargassum habitat,local dolphin abundance,0,local abundance is determined by Sargassum habitat availability
sargassum habitat,local wahoo abundance,0,local abundance is determined by Sargassum habitat availability
seafood imports,seafood supply,0,increased seafood imports will increase the total seafood supply
seasonal changes,migratory patterns,0,migrations are affected by seasonal changes; specifically temperature
sharks,catch per unit effort,0,increased shark populations lead to reduced CPUE due to depredation
sharks,charter CPUE,0,increased shark populations lead to reduced CPUE due to depredation
social media,charter business,0,social media pictures generate interest and increase charter business demand
social media,community conflict,0,
social media,private recreational effort,0,social media pictures generate interest and increase private rec effort
temperature,sargassum habitat,0,
trust and buy in,community conflict,0,a lack of trust among managers or community memebers creates conflict

tuna availability,commercial effort council,0,the availability of tuna drives Council boat effort in this region
tuna availability,PLL effort,0,the availability of tuna drives pelagic longlining effort in this region
