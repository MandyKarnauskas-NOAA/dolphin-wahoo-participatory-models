consumer satisfaction,VB,customer satisfaction,use single standard term
cost of bait,BFT,,
council boat catch,WAN,council boat landings,standardize term catch to landings: important to maintain distinction between Council landings and PLL Landings because PLL landings point towards the large dolphin abundance and Council landings don't (for WAN)

different soc patterns of areas of SE,WAN,XXXXrevisitXXXX,should this point to lack of data on private recreational catch in the model or should it pont towards something else?  (e.g. accountability).  What was the point about the different social patterns?

effort shift to trigger and beeliner,BFT,,
fishing efficiency,VB,charter fishing efficiency,I think this is all about charter so we may as well use standardized term for that
fishing effort Gulf of Guinea,BFT,international fishing effort,make the term more generalizable
fishing power,WAN,engine horsepower,use single standard term; power was being discussed in the context of overall technological advances leading to increased effort (technology may be OK but it was also in the context of people investing in much bigger more powerful boats… so we may want to review this one?)

Gulf Stream eddies,BFT,,
hurricanes,BFT,,"term is used elsewhere.  (""I think here they may have been referring specifically to the disruptive impact of catastrophic events hurricanes in particular from an economic and social standpoint.  The other two are referring to the impact of weather on the biological system. )"

large dolphin local abundance,WAN,local large dolphin abundance,use single standard term
level of regulations,BFT,level of Council boat regulations,
local business profit,WAN,local profits,"standardize term used elsewhere.  (I think that in the meeting they were talking specifically not about profits in general but about the impact of these things on the profit of local dealers and fish houses.  Maybe it could be ""local profits"". i.e.  It was about how these international things affect local profits)"
local dolphin abundance,WAN,,
local dolphin and wahoo abundance,BFT,local dolphin abundance,these are separated elsewhere so separate here
local dolphin and wahoo abundance,BFT,local wahoo abundance,these are separated elsewhere so separate here (it will make the model a bit messier for BFT but yeah should separate)

number of longline fishermen,BFT,,
number of recreational fishermen,BFT,number of private recreational fishermen,"I think that ""number of local fishermen"" and ""number of recreational fishermen"" are referring to the same type of fishermen in this model.  There is another arrow going from ""economy"" to ""demand for charter"" "
pictures on social media,VB,impressiveness of social media photos,"use single standard term (I guess ""presence"" may be OK but the conversation was really about getting impressive photos for social media.  So maybe it is about ""number and size of fish in social media photos?).  How can we operationalize ""social media presence"" in the case for example of private charter or anglers who are taking vanity photos?  They want to land a lot of fish so they can take impressive photos...""impressiveness of photos for social media"".  Lets discuss."
