local large dolphin abundance,fishing efficiency,NA,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year
local small dolphin abundance,fishing efficiency,NA,dolphin can only be caught when they are locally available at certain times of year
availability of bait fish,local large dolphin abundance,NA,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines
availability of bait fish,local small dolphin abundance,NA,bait concentrations are what draw dolphin to the weedlines
demand for charter trips,number of charter trips,NA,the number of charter trips is driven by the demand for charters
charter landings,social media presence,NA,more charter landings drive more pictures of the catch on social media
charter landings,total local dolphin landings,NA,total local landings increase as charter landings increase
charter landings,trip activity excitement,NA,higher catches contribute to the excitement of charter trips
commercial fishing effort,total local dolphin landings,NA,total local landings increase as the commercial effort increases
concentration of dolphin,commercial fishing effort,NA,in some areas dolphin do not occur in sufficient concentrations for them to be targeted by commercial fisheries
demand for charter trips,demand for charter trips,NA,these are essentially the same
customer satisfaction,demand for charter trips,NA,satisfication with charter trips drives an increase in demand for the activity
desirability for meat,customer satisfaction,NA,catching dolphin contributes to consumer satisfaction because they are a highly desireable meat fish
desirability for meat,total local dolphin landings,NA,changed to NA because I think this is erroneous - desireability leads to increased effort but not landings? 
distance from fish,private recreational effort,NA,in some locations along the coast the dolphin are only available further offshore and this is a limiting factor for some private anglers
total dolphin population abundance,local large dolphin abundance,NA,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin
total dolphin population abundance,local small dolphin abundance,NA,locally available dolphin are a part of the larger stock unit of unknown origin
Gulf Stream eddies,presence of surface objects,NA,eddy activity drives local convergence zones where floating objects congregate
fishing efficiency,total local dolphin landings,NA,as fishing efficiency or catchability increases there are more landings per unit effort
Gulf Stream position ,Gulf Stream eddies,NA,the Gulf Stream produces eddies as it flows and interacts with the ocean floor
number of charter trips,charter landings,NA,the charter landings increase as the total number of trips increases
social media presence,customer satisfaction,NA,consumer satisfaction is driven by excitement over pictures of catch which are shared on social media
social media presence,private recreational effort,NA,when local folks see pictures of charter catches on social media they go out fishing
private recreational effort,private landings,NA,landings from private anglers increase as the private sector effort increases
private landings,social media presence,NA,private anglers upload pictures of their catches to social media
private landings,total local dolphin landings,NA,private angler landings contribute to the total dolphin landings locally
seasonal migration,local large dolphin abundance,NA,large gaffer dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate
seasonal migration,local small dolphin abundance,NA,small dolphin are locally available at certain times of the year as they seasonally migrate
shark abundance,commercial fishing effort,NA,high abundance of sharks makes it impractical to fish for dolphin commercially in some areas
presence of surface objects,availability of bait fish,NA,bait concentrate around the weedlines and other floating objects
temperature breaks,presence of surface objects,NA,temperature breaks are also frontal zones that cause floating objects to congregate
number of tournaments,total local dolphin landings,NA,tournament effort affects the total number of local landings
number of tournaments,use of circle hooks,NA,tournaments require the use of circle hooks
trip activity excitement,customer satisfaction,NA,consumer satisfaction is driven by the number and variety of fish caught; often dolphin is an important species within this mix
tropical weather systems,Gulf Stream position ,NA,tropical weather systems affect the position of the Gulf Stream
tropical weather systems,water clarity,NA,tropical weather systems affect water conditions and clarity; e g  inshore runoff
tropical weather systems,wind strength,NA,tropical weather systems affect wind patterns on short temporal scales
marlin availability,demand for charter trips,NA,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the demand for charter trips
marlin availability,private recreational effort,NA,the availability of tuna and marlin drives much of the private angler effort offshore
use of circle hooks,fishing efficiency,NA,less likely to retain hooked small dolphin on a circle hook; reduced efficiency
water clarity,availability of bait fish,NA,bait are not necessarily found on all weed lines; it depends on water quality as well
temperature,seasonal migration,NA,seasonal migrations of dolphin are largely determined by water temperature
temperature,marlin availability,NA,tuna and marlin are locally available for capture at certain times of the year driven by water temperature
weather,private recreational effort,NA,bad weather makes it difficult to go fishing and reduces private angler effort
wind strength,presence of surface objects,NA,strong winds break up convergence zones and Sargassum lines
X ,total dolphin population abundance,NA,the factors driving the total dolphin abundance at the population scale are unknown
