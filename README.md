# dolphin-wahoo-participatory-models
code for organizing, processing, and analyzing conceptual models from SAFMC dolphin-wahoo workshops

#############################################################################
processConceptualModels.r is step-wise code for organization


Step 1. Put conceptual model into Mental Modeler and export as .csv

workshopLocation.mmp is Mental Modeler input file (generated by hand from raw workshop outputs)
CHANGE_LOG describes any changes that were made during input to Mental Modeler 
workshopLocation_mm.png is picture of clean mental model
workshopLocation_matrix.csv is Mental Modeler output in matrix form


Step 2. Read file into R and sort matrix into list of relationships
workshopLocation_relationships.csv is matrix relationships in list form


Step 3. Fill out description column of the relationships_edited.csv
   	# check conceptual models and update any linkages necessary
workshopLocation_relationships_edited.csv is matrix relationships in list form with comments 


Step 4. Merge edited mental models with relationships_edited.csv
workshopLocation_relationships_edited.csv is updated with new linkages


Step 5. Create list of terms
all_terms.csv is full list of terms across workshops


Step 6. Standardize list of terms
all_terms_edited.csv is manually edited term list


Step 7. Update relationship flat file with new terminology
workshopLocation_relationships_newterm.csv is relationship file with new terms


Step 8. Specify positive and negaitve relationships
workshopLocation_relationships_newterm_scored.csv is relationship file with +/- scores


Step 9. Convert back to matrix format
workshopLocation_matrix_newterms.csv is matrix form with clean terminology and scored relationships
input this back into Mental Modeler or continue analysis
