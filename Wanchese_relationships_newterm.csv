robustness of management,level of private recreational regulations,NA,synonymous; level of ability to manage impacts level of ability to create regulations
bycatch standards,import price,NA,the presence of bycatch does not cause the price to be lower; perhaps replace with 'bycatch standards' so that relationship is apparent; lower standards allow cost savings and reduce price
international fishing effort,total dolphin population abundance,NA,international fishing effort has an impact on the overall population abundance
international fishing effort,import price,NA,with increased effort there is increased supply and the price decreases
international fishing effort,bycatch standards,NA,international fisheries have less stringent regulations and therefore produce more bycatch
international fishing effort,unreported catch,NA,increase in international effort leads to increase in unreported catch
availability of data on private recreational catch,accountability,NA,lack of data for private rec sector reduces the accountability in the fishery
availability of data on private recreational catch,robustness of management,NA,NA
level of private recreational regulations,availability of data on private recreational catch,NA,if not regulated then it makes it difficult to collect data
level of private recreational regulations,private recreational effort,NA,few regulations leads to unconstrained effort
local large dolphin abundance,demand for charter trips,NA,lack of large dolphin locally decreases charter trip satisfaction and demand
local large dolphin abundance,local dolphin abundance,NA,an increase in large dolphin abundance is equivalent to an increase in total abundance
local dolphin abundance,charter business opportunity,NA,local abundance increases opportunity for charter businesses
local dolphin abundance,community conflict,NA,when local abundance is depleted it creates community conflict
local dolphin abundance,number of tournaments,NA,local abundance increases opportunity for tournament fishing
seasonal migration,local dolphin abundance,NA,the local abundance of dolphin is affected by their seasonal migrations
seasonal migration,local wahoo abundance,NA,the local abundance of wahoo is affected by their seasonal migrations
mobility of recreational anglers,private recreational effort,NA,greater mobility of recreational anglers (e g  with trailers) allows for increased private recreational effort
ability to assess stock,robustness of management,NA,a lack of stock assessments for dolphin and wahoo make them challenging to manage
number of council  boats,Council boat fishing effort,NA,as the number of council boats increases the commercial effort will increase
PLL landings,local large dolphin abundance,NA,PLL fishery targets large dolphin and causes local depletion
PLL landings,seafood supply,NA,NA
PLL fleet efficiency,PLL landings,NA,NA
PLL effort,bycatch of sharks,NA,increased longline effort will increase bycatch of sharks and other species
PLL effort,PLL landings,NA,increased longline effort will increase the landings
private recreational effort,local dolphin abundance,NA,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local dolphin abundance
private recreational effort,local wahoo abundance,NA,increase in private recreational effort results in decreased local wahoo abundance
private recreational effort,unreported sales,NA,increase in private recreational effort results in more opportunities for unreported sales
public information campaigns,level of regulations on sharks,NA,pressure to reduce fishing on sharks led to stronger regulations
quality of information,level of Council boat regulations,NA,
range shifts,seasonal migration,NA,large-scale range shifts lead to changing migration patterns; e g  fish moving further north
level of Council boat regulations,number of council  boats,NA,few regulations leads to unconstrained effort
level of regulations on bait,PLL fleet efficiency,NA,whole squid must be used and this decreases CPUE
level of regulations on sharks,shark abundance,NA,stronger restrictions on shark fishing have led to increase in shark populations
presence of Sargassum mats,local dolphin abundance,NA,local abundance is determined by Sargassum habitat availability
presence of Sargassum mats,local wahoo abundance,NA,local abundance is determined by Sargassum habitat availability
seafood imports,seafood supply,NA,increased seafood imports will increase the total seafood supply
seasonal changes,seasonal migration,NA,migrations are affected by seasonal changes; specifically temperature
shark abundance,charter fishing efficiency,NA,increased shark populations lead to reduced CPUE due to depredation
shark abundance,council boat efficiency,NA,increased shark populations lead to reduced CPUE due to depredation
