############        Beaufort model       ##############

- bycatch of billfish, turtles, related to commercial effort, NOT number of longline fishermen
- dolphin/wahoo catchability submodel was not related to anything in larger model; inserted linkage to landings because they are a function of both effort and catchability
- original model had link from recreational landings to recreational effort; this is wrong and relationship should be inverted
- factors influencing recreational landings were unclear; put in linkages coming from "recreational effort" and "range of fishing" 
- unclear if there was a linkage from "recreational landings" to "ability to catch dolphin/wahoo throughout the year"?  left out for now
- single linkages from charter demand --> overall NC charter industry --> economic impact.  changed the latter two to "economic impact of NC charter industry"
- should "profits" be linked to "economic impact of NC charter industry?" 
- "access to fish" post-it was left unlinked to model
- infrastructure to support fishing" also left unlinked to model

############        Wanchese model       ##############

- model originally had sargassum --> wahoo abundance --> range shifts --> local abundance; this is wrong.  
  solution: local abundance should be a function of stock abundance, migration patterns, and local effort
- also originally had FL abundance and other regional abundance; these were not connected to international effort
  solution: make a population-level abundance box which is then broken down into regions; international effort linked to overall population abundance
- range shifts were overlaying migratory patterns; changed so that migration is a function of both seasonal and range shifts
- PLL effort was going directly into local dolphin abundance and also commercial catch; took out linkage to abundance and changed to "PLL catch"
- demand for charter trips was not linked to anything; link to charter effort
- seafood imports should be linked to import price or local business profit? 
- changed tournaments to be influenced by "local abundance" rather than total population abundance 
- removed linkage from "trust/buy-in" to "charter business" as this did not seem to make sense
- create link from lack of data to inability to manage
- fishing power linked to effort instead of mobility
- add link from large dolphin abundance to charter demand

#########        Virginia Beach model       ###########

- remove link from availability of dolphin to landings -- is this correct?  
  solution: availability of dolphin --> fishing efficiency --> landings
- put in extra link from charter trips --> landings, now charter trips --> charter landings --> total local dolphin landings
- reversed arrow on desirability for eating --> landings (not landings driving desireability for eating as in original model
- changed tuna/marlin fishing --> charter demand to tuna/marlin fishing --> consumer demand
- Note: could probably get rid of "consumer demand" and combine consumer/charter demand since they are basically equal
- broke landings down into private and charter landings
- link from private landings to total landings was missing
- (lack of) commercial fishing effort was not connected; linked to total landings
