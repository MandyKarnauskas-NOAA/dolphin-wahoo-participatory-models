displacement from other fisheries,number of longline fishermen,NA,entry into longline fishery is driven by displacement from other fisheries that have become unprofitable
dolphin catchability,recreational landings,NA,increased catchability leads to increased landings assuming stable effort
strength of economy,demand for charter trips,NA,a strong economy leads to more spending and increased demand for charter trips
strength of economy,number of recreational fishermen,NA,a strong economy leads to more spending and an increase in recreational fishermen
international fishing effort,YFT population size,NA,international fishing effort has decreased population abundance of yellowfin tuna
fuel price,profits,NA,increased fuel prices will decrease charter profits
fuel price,recreational fishing effort,NA,increased fuel prices will decrease recreational offshore fishing effort because it is expensive to go offshore
Gulf Stream eddies,temperature breaks,NA,Gulf Stream eddies structure the frontal zones where temperature breaks occur
tropical weather systems,profits,NA,hurricanes can have a negative influence on profits over short time scales
international supply,price of dolphin,NA,international supply of dolphin affects local market price
level of regulations,number of longline fishermen,NA,the open access nature of the dolphin longline fishery has facilitated entry
entry costs,number of longline fishermen,NA,low entry costs into fishery drives an increase in number of fishermen
number of private recreational fishermen,recreational fishing effort,NA,an increase in the number of local fishermen causes an increase in recreational effort
number of longline fishermen,commercial fishing effort,NA,an increase in the number of fishermen will increase effort
number of recreational fishermen,range of recreational fishing,NA,fishermen are going further to get away from the crowds created by greater numbers of fishermen
number of recreational fishermen,recreational fishing effort,NA,as the number of recreational fishermen increases effort also increases
presence of Sargassum mats,availability of bait fish,NA,bait fish are found under sargassum mats
presence of Sargassum mats,dolphin catchability,1,dolphin are found under sargassum mats and other floating objects
presence of Sargassum mats,wahoo catchability,0.28,wahoo are found under sargassum mats and other floating objects
price of dolphin,number of longline fishermen,NA,an increased market price makes the fishery more profitable and affects the number of commercial fishermen
range of recreational fishing,recreational landings,NA,an increased range of recreational fisheries increases the availability and therefore landings of fish
recreational fishing effort,recreational landings,NA,a decrease in recreational fishing effort with reduce landings
recreational landings,local dolphin abundance,NA,recreational landings affect local abundance of wahoo and dolphin
risk of low catch,range of recreational fishing,NA,access to technology allows mediocre fishermen to go out farther (decreasing risk of not catching anything) which increases the range that they can cover
season length for YFT,recreational fishing effort,NA,a reduction in season length for yellowfin tuna causes increase in effort on dolphin and wahoo
seasonal migration,ability to catch dolphin and wahoo through year,NA,the ability to catch wahoo and dolphin during different parts of the year is affected by their seasonal migrations
strength of sewage regulations,coastal development,NA,the strength of the sewage regulations have limited coastal development in some areas
bag limits,ability to catch dolphin and wahoo through year,NA,size and bag limits decrease ability of wahoo and dolphin throuhout the year because different size classes are in abundance in different seasons
bag limits,customer satisfaction,NA,if you don't let customers bring back as much meat it will reduce satisfaction; people want to take full coolers home
desirability for meat,price of dolphin,NA,dolphin fetches a higher price because it is tasty
technology,dolphin catchability,NA,NA
technology,range of recreational fishing,NA,fishing technology (e.g. engine capacity) increases the range over which recreational fishermen operate
technology,wahoo catchability,NA,NA
temperature breaks,dolphin catchability,NA,dolphin tend to congregate at temperature breaks or frontal zones
temperature breaks,wahoo catchability,NA,wahoo tend to congregate at temperature breaks or frontal zones
